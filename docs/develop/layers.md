    * Multiple Nodes can be created (1)
        * Each node can have controls (compare controls in WLED / StarLight) ✅
        * Each node can run precompile code or Live scripts (with or without loop) ✅
        * Each node has a type:
            * Layout: tell where each light is in a 1D/2D/3D physical coordinate space (based on StarLight fixtures) ✅
            * Effect: 
                * run an effect in a virtual coordinate space ✅
                * in the physical space if you want to run at highest performance, e.g. a random effect doesn't need to go through mappings ✅
            * Modifier: Mirror, rotate, etc, multiple modfiers allowed (projection in StarLight) 🚧
                * A modifier can also map lights dimensions to effect dimensions: change the lights to a 1D/2D/3D virtual coordinate space
                    * e.g. if the light is a globe, you can map that to 2D using mercator projection mapping
                    * if the light is 200x200 you can map it to 50x50
                    * if the light is 2D, a 1D effect can be shown as a circle or a bar (as WLED expand1D)
            * Driver show: show the result on Leds (using FastLED, hpwit drivers), Art-Net, DDP, ...
    * Future situation: Nodes and noodles (2)
        * Replace the nodes table (1) by a graphical view (2)
    * Virtual Layer (MappingTable) (3)
        * Array of arrays. Outer array is virtual lights, inner array is physical lights. ✅
        * Implemented efficiently using the StarLight PhysMap struct ✅
        * e.g. [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]] ✅
            * first virtual light is not mapped to a physical light
            * second virtual light is mapped to physical light 0
            * third virtual light is mapped to physical lights 1 and 2
            * and so on
        * Virtual lights can be 1D, 2D or 3D. Physical lights also, in any combination
            * Using x + y * sizeX + z * sizeX * sizeY 🚧
        * set/getLightColor functions used in effects using the MappingTable ✅
        * Nodes manipulate the MappingTable and/or interfere in the effects loop 🚧
        * A Virtual Layer mapping gets updated if a layout, mapping or dimensions change 🚧
        * An effect uses a virtual layer. One Virtual layer can have multiple effects. ✅
    * Physical layer
        * Lights.header and Lights.channels. CRGB leds[] is using lights.channels (acting like leds[] in FASTLED) ✅
        * A Physical layer has one or more virtual layers and a virtual layer has one or more effects using it. ✅
    * Presets/playlist: change (part of) the nodes model
    
    ✅: Done

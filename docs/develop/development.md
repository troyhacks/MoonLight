## Developing

* Read the [ESP32 Sveltekit docs](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/esp32sveltekit/)
* Read [Customizing Sveltekit](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/customizingsveltekit/)
* Create a fork so you have your own environment to make changes to. See also Pull Requests below.
* Changes made to the UI are not always visible in the browser, clear the browser cache to see latest UI (see [connect to MoonLight](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/gettingstarted/installation/#connect-moonlight)).
* Serial Log shows which code is from which library using emoji:

    * üêº: ESP-SvelteKit
    * üîÆ: PsychicHTTP
    * üê∏: Live Scripts
    * üåô: MoonBase
    * üí´: MoonLight
    üåô and üí´ is also used in code comments of ESP32-SvelteKit to show where changes to upstream have been made.
* The following ESP32-SvelteKit features have been switched off in the default builts (they can be switched on if you want to use them, see [features.ini](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/blob/main/features.ini))
    *   -D FT_SECURITY=0
    *   ~~-D FT_SLEEP=1~~ enabled!
    *   ~~-D FT_BATTERY=1~~ enabled!

## Where you can help

* Improve the web installer
* Improve the UI (Svelte 5, DaisyUI 5, TailWind 4)
  * Mutli row layout
* Tune FastLED, add FastLED 2D effects
* CI automation (Generate daily builds in Github and use by installer)

## Adding functionality

* lib folder for Sveltekit back end
* src folder for MoonBase and MoonLight back end
* interface folder for front end development
    * interface/src/routes/moonbase for MoonBase and MoonLight (modules)


* ‚òëÔ∏è and ‚û°Ô∏è to build and or upload

### Front End (UI)
üöß

* interface folder
* see [Prepare for development](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/installation/#prepare-for-development) about nodejs, npm install

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

* see [Troubleshooting](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/installation/#troubleshooting) about WWWData.h

### Back End (Server)

There are 3 levels to add functionality:

* **Standard ESP32-Sveltekit code**, e.g. Connections, Wifi and System. MoonBase files is also made using standard sveltekit as example but contains a few components used in MoonLight modules. Might be rewriteen as MoonLight Module in the future.
* [MoonLight Modules](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/modules/) e.g. Lights Control, Effects, Info, Channels. They are subclasses of Modules.h/cpp and implement setupDefinition, onUpdate and optional loop. New modules need to be defined in main.cpp and added to menu.svelte. All further UI is generated by Module.svelte.
* **MoonLight Nodes**: the easiest and recommended way. See Effects.h, Layouts.h, Modifiers.h and Mods.h for examples. They match closest WLED usermods. Each node has controls, a setup and a loop and can be switched on and off. For specific purposes hasLayout and hasModifier can be set.

### Adding an ESP32 device Definition

Before starting, ensure you have the datasheet of your particular chip and ESP32-device confirmed and available. Many modules have near-identical markings that can hide varying hardware.

There are 3 files to consider when making a ESP32-device definition.

	boards/BOARD_NAME.csv
	boards/BOARD_NAME.JSON
	firmware/BOARD_TYPE_NAME.ini (e.g. esp32dev, esp32-s3), contains different boards

### Technical notes

#### Live Scripts

* Uses ESPLiveScripts, see compileAndRun. compileAndRun is started when in Nodes a file.sc is choosen
    * To do: kill running scripts, e.g. when changing effects

#### File Manager

## Technical

* filesState: all files on FS
* folderList: all files in a folder
* editableFile: current file
* getState / postFilesState: get filesState and post changes to files (update, delete, new)
* addFile / addFolder: create new items
* breadcrumbs(String): folder path as string array and as string, stored in localStorage
* folderListFromBreadCrumbs: create folderList of current folder
* handleEdit: when edit button pressed: navigate back and forward through folders, edit current file
* confirmDelete: when delete button pressed
* socket files / handleFileState (->folderListFromBreadCrumbs)

Using component FileEdit, see [Components](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/components/#fileedit)

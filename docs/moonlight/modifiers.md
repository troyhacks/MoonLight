# Modifiers

A modifier (💎) is an effect on an effect. It can change the size of the effect layer, and moves effect effect pixels around (e.g. rotate) or expand to other dimensions, e.g. a line can become a circle.

!!! tip

    Multiple modifiers can be defined per layer. The order of multipliers matter e.g. rotate then multiply is different then multiply then rotate.

Below is a list of Modifiers in MoonLight. 
Want to add a Modifier to MoonLight, see [develop](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/overview/). See also [Live scripts](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonlight/livescripts/) to add runtime Modifiers.

The following Modifiers are defined in MoonLight. Some found there origin in WLED and WLED-MM (Expand1D):

| RippleYZ 🧊 | ![RippleYZ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0918efac-6367-420f-b0e3-d796d9551953) | <img width="320" alt="RippleYZ" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ecf22c-c4c1-4ee9-8096-fd5613fbb1a7" /> | 1D/2D effect will be rippled to 2D/3D (🚨)<br>Shrink: shrinks the original size towards Y and Z, towardsY: copies X into Y, towardsZ: copies XY into Z |

🚨: some effects already do this theirselves e.g. FreqMatrix runs on 1D but copies to 2D and 3D if size allows.

# Layouts

A layout (🚥) defines the positions of lights connected to a MoonLight device.

* The **coordinates** of each light are defined in a 3D coordinate space 
    * Coordinates needs to be specified in the order the lights are wired so MoonLight knows which light is first, which is second etc.
    * For lights in a straight line (1D, e.g. LED strips or a LED bar), specify coordinates as [x,0,0] 
    * For lights in a flat area (2D, e.g. LED matrix), specify coordinates as [x,y,0] 
* **Multiple layout nodes** can be defined which will be mapped in the order of the layouts
* MoonLight will use the layout definition to generate a **mapping** of the effects to a real world light layout. Most simple example is a panel which has a snake layout. The mapping will create a layer for effects where the snake layout is hidden.
* Layouts also assign groups of LEDs to esp32 GPIO pins.

## Layout 🚥 Nodes

Below is a list of Layouts in MoonLight. 
Want to add a a Layout to MoonLight, see [develop](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/develop/overview/). See also [Live scripts](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonlight/livescripts/) to add runtime effects.

!!! warning "Choosing pins"

    Choose the right pins with care. See also the IO module to see which pins can in general be used for LEDs (💡). But depending on a specific boards some pins might also be in use already. 

!!! tip "Multiple layouts"
    Single line, single row or panel are suitable layouts to combine into a larger fixture.

### SE16

16 channel LED strip driver by Stephane Electronics

* Leds Per Pin: the number of LEDs connected to each pin
* Pins Are Columns: are the LEDs on a pin a row of the effect (width is 1 (or 2) x ledsPerPin). If not set the LEDs are a column (height is 1 (or 2) x ledsPerPin)
* Mirrored Pins: If set it is assumed that LEDs are connected with increasing positions on 8 pins on one side of the board and decreasing positions on the 8 pins of the other side of the board. The resulting size will have a width of 8 and the height (or width) will be 2 * ledsPerPin. If not set, the width will be 16 and the height (or width) = ledsPerPin
* Pins: 47,48,21,38,14,39,13,40,12,41,11,42,10,2,3,1

# IO Module

<img width="320" height="441" alt="io11" src="../../media/moonbase/inputoutput.png" />

Defines hardware specifics per ESP32 device 🆕

Currently the following boards are defined. Not all are supported yet 🚧

<img width="320" height="441" alt="io11" src="../../media/moonbase/inputoutputpresets.png" />

For each board the following presets are defined:

* Modded: set when any pin differs from the selected board preset. Press off to return to the preset defaults.
* Max Power in Watts: adjust the brightness to approach this max power, depending on the number of LEDs used. Default 10: 5V * 2A = 10W (so it runs fine on USB). Used by LED drivers, see [Drivers](../../moonlight/drivers/)
* Switch1 and 2: If the board contains a jumper or pins have different functions, a custom switch can be set. Eg. select between Infrared and Ethernet. If a switch is turned on or off, the board the modded status will not change. See boards below for details
* Pins: Assign functionality to gpio pins. Other modules and nodes use the pin assignments made here.
    * GPIO = gpio_num;
    * Usage: See below
    * Index: specify first, second, third, ... usage output, e.g. LED D01 to LED D16
    * Summary
       * Valid (✅)
       * Output (💡)
       * RTC (⏰);
    * Level (HIGH, LOW, N/A)
    * DriveCap (WEAK, STRONGER, MEDIUM, STRONGEST, N/A)

## Pin usage

  * Supported
    * LEDs 🚦: Used by LED drivers to setup LED outputs, see [Drivers](../../moonlight/drivers/)
    * Voltage and Current ⚡️: Sets energy monitoring, see [System status](../../system/status) and [System Metrics](../../system/metrics)
    * Infrared ♨️: Used by IR driver, see [Drivers](../../moonlight/drivers/)
    * Button LightsOn 🛎️/𓐟: sets on/off in [Light Control](../../moonlight/lightscontrol/), Push (🛎️) and Toggle (𓐟)
    * Relay LightsOn 🔀: sets on/off in [Light Control](../../moonlight/lightscontrol/)
    * SPI_SCK, SPI_MISO, SPI_MOSI, PHY_CS, PHY_IRQ 🔗: S3 Ethernet, Used by the Ethernet module, see [Ethernet](../../network/ethernet/)
  * Planned soon
    * Battery
    * DMX
  * Planned later
    * I2S for microphone and line in
    * I2C

## Naming convention

- MicroController (MCU): The ESP32 chip
- MCU-Board (MCB): MCU on a PCB
- Carrier Board (CRB): board that the MCU-board plugs into (Or shield or controller board or interface board)
- Device (DVC): All of the above in a box with connectors

## Board details

### QuinLed boards

* [Dig 2Go](https://quinled.info/quinled-dig2go/), [Dig Uno](https://quinled.info/pre-assembled-quinled-dig-uno/), [Dig Quad](https://quinled.info/pre-assembled-quinled-dig-quad/): Choose the esp32-d0 (4MB) board in the [MoonLight Installer](../../gettingstarted/installer/) 
* [Dig Octa](https://quinled.info/quinled-dig-octa/): Choose the esp32-d0-16mb board in the [MoonLight Installer](../../gettingstarted/installer/) 
* On first install, erase flash first (Especially when other firmware like WLED was on it) as MoonLight uses a partition scheme with 3MB of flash (currently no OTA support).
* After install, select the QuinLED board preset to have the pins assigned correctly.

!!! tip "Reset router"
    You might need to reset your router if you first run WLED on the same board and no new IP is assigned.

!!! Tip "Dig Uno USB"
    Remove fuse to connect USB cable to flash the board.

### MyHome-Control ESP32-P4 shield

![ESP32-P4 shield](https://shop.myhome-control.de/thumbnail/87/41/c2/1762031307/WLED_ESP32_P4_Shield_02_1920x1326.jpg?ts=1762031315){: style="width:320px"}

* See [ESP32-P4 shield](https://shop.myhome-control.de/en/ABC-WLED-ESP32-P4-shield/HW10027). Choose the esp32-p4-nano board in the [MoonLight Installer](../../gettingstarted/installer/) 
* On new ESP32-P4 Nano boards, the WiFi coprocessor needs to be updated first to a recent version, currently ESP-Hosted v2.0.17, see the link in the [MoonLight Installer](../../gettingstarted/installer/)
* After install, select the **MHC P4 Nano Shield** board preset to have the pins assigned correctly.
    * Assuming 100W LED power; change if needed.
    * Switch1: (also set the switches on the board)
        * off (default): 16 LED pins. 
        * On: 8 LED pins, 4 RS-485 pins and 4 exposed pins 
    * Switch2: 
        * off (default): Pins 10, 11, 12, 13 used for build-in Mic over I2S, pin 7 and 8: I2C SDA and SCL
        * On: Pins 33, 25, 32, 36 used for Line in, pin 7 and 8: additional LED pins. 
* Add the Parallel LED Driver, see [Drivers](../../moonlight/drivers/). It uses [@troyhacks](https://github.com/troyhacks) his parallel IO driver to drive all LED pins configured for the shield.


### SE16 v1

![SE-16p](../firmware/installer/images/esp32-s3-stephanelec-16p.jpg){: style="width:100px"}

* Choose the esp32-s3-devkitc-1-n8r8v board in the [MoonLight Installer](../../gettingstarted/installer/) 
* Set Switch1 the same as you set the jumper on the board: off / default: Infrared. on: Ethernet.

MoonLight is based on nodes (see [Effects](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/module/effects/) and [Drivers](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/module/drivers/)) where each node can run precompiled layouts, effects or modifiers but alternatively, each node can also run a live script, uploaded on the esp32 file system (.sc files).
Currently this only works on esp32-S3 boards as normal esp32 boards do not have enough memory to flash MoonLight with the Live Scripts option.

This module shows all running live scripts

* Scrips: Running Live scripts (üöß)
* Press the edit button to stop start or kill a script (current bug: double click the button)

## How to run a live script

**Step 1**: Select [Moonbase / File Manager](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/files/) from the menu and select a location to store live scripts. Create a **folder** if needed (press the second + button):

**Step 2**: Go to this folder and create a **file** (press the first + button). Give the file a name ending with .sc and enter the code. See [github livescripts](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/tree/main/misc/livescripts) for example scripts (E_*.sc files are effects L_*.sc files are layouts). Alternatively you can also upload a live script with by pressing the Upload File button. Press save:

**Step 3**: Select [MoonLight / Effects](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/module/effects/) or [MoonLight / Drivers](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/module/drivers/) from the menu. Create a new effect node (üî•) by pressing the + button or update an existing effect node (üî•) by pressing the ‚úê-button. Open the drop down and scroll to the bottom where live script files are shown

**Step 4**: Select the script, the script will be compiled (takes a second or so) and executed. You can see the effect controls on the bottom of the screen (speed and branches in this example), change them to customise the effect:

**Step 5**: Live scripts can be edited in the node press the ‚úê-button of a live script node and press the v next to Edit <livescript.sc> and the same edit window as in Step 2 opens. Do your edits and press save. The  script recompiles and will restart the effect. (Alternatively if a script is running and you edit a file in the file manager, the script will also recompile and rerun). For a list of functions currently supported, see [live script functions](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/blob/3058728e043a3f956e79cf88d99684d02d6c2b38/src/MoonLight/Nodes.cpp#L136-L181).

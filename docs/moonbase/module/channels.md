Shows each channel within the light array. e.g. for a LED strip or panel each light is 3 (or 4 in case of RGBW) channels. For multichannel lights like Moving heads.
If you hover over a channel, that channel will output a value - by this you can reverse engineer positions of existing lights, e.g. when you output to an unknown DMX setup.

* View: select between physical layer and virtual layer(s)
* Group: group all channels in a light as one button. Pressing the button sets all the channels to max
* Universe: Change the range of channels to control - ðŸš§!

Choosing the virtual layer and hovering over the channels is a good way to test effect modifiers

hint: do not run effects when using the channels module as they will also fill the channels with data (set them to off in the Effects module)

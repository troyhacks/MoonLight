## Overview

The Effects module defines effects and modifiers. They run in a 'layer'. 

* Effect ðŸ”¥: An animation running in a coordinate space, e.g. a graphical equalizer or game of life
* Modifier ðŸ’Ž: An effect on an effect e.g. mirror, multiply or rotate
* Layer: An area on a (LED) display. Effects and modifier run in this area. Each layer maps a coordinate space to the display

!!! info

    Until v0.6.0 there is only one layer, projected on the whole display. Multiple layers is planned after v0.6.0

!!! tip

    Livescripts... A node can be precompiled in the firmware or defined by a live script loaded onto the File System (See File Manager).

## Controls

* Layer: Choose the layer - currently only one layer supported
    * Start, End and Brightness: read only for now, when multiple layers are implemented (>v0.6.0), these can be set per layer
* Nodes: effects and modifiers will be shown as nodes with controls
    * Reorder: Nodes can be reordered, defining the order of executions (effects: which effect on top of the other effect. Modifiers: which modifier is done first, e.g. circle then multiply will yield to a different result than multiply then circle)
    * Controls. A node can be switched on and off and has custom controls, which defines the parameters of the node (e.g. effect speed).

## Details

* **Effect** ðŸ”¥: Effects can run in 1D, 2D or 3D coordinate spaces.

!!! info

    Traditionally effects where mostly 1D running on LED strips, when LED matrices became available 2D effects where created. More and more LED art installations have a 3D shape so also support for 3D is desirable. MoonLight is build from the ground to support 3D. Basic idea is that a 1D effect is 3D where y and z is 0, 2D has z is 0. This means modifiying an effect to run in 3D is possible. This can be done using modifiers, but also the source code of an effect can be changed to support more dimensions (see development).

* **Modifier** ðŸ’Ž: a modifier is an effect on an effect. It can change the size of the virtual layer, it can map the pixels other then 1:1 (e.g. mirror, multiply them or a 1D line can become a 2D circle) and it can change each light set in an effect during a loop (e.g. rotate the effect)

!!! tip

    Multiple effects and modifiers can be defined per layer. MoonLight supports unlimited number of them per layer. They will all run after each other, this is useful for modifiers as you can combine them: e.g. rotate then multiply creates four (or more) rotating effects.

## Effect ðŸ”¥ Nodes
ðŸš§
Precompiled effects can be found in [effects](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/blob/main/src/MoonLight/Effects.h)

### Solid ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¡

* Sends a solid RGB to all lights
* Controls: Red, Green, Blue, Brightness
* Usage: Can be used as background to other effects, order it before other effects

### Scrolling text ðŸ”¥

* ðŸš§: Currently shows system info on leds. You need at least 16*6 pixels for that (Panel 16x16 recommended). Later custom texts will be possible
* Controls:
    * Speed: scrolling speed if the text is wider then the display width
    * Font: Different font sizes
    * Preset: one of the following: Auto, IP (.ddd), FPS (ddds), Time (HHMM), Uptime (s/m/h), Status ðŸ›œ (AP/STA), Clients ðŸ›œ (dC), Connected ðŸ›œ (dCC)

### PanTilt script

* Sends a beatsin to Pan and Tilt which can be sent to Moving Heads (add a Moving head layout node to configure the MHs)
* Controls: BPM, Middle Pan and Tilt, Range and invert
* Usage: Add this effect if moving heads are configured. RGB effects can be added separately e.g. wave to light up the moving heads in wave patterns
* See [E_PanTilt](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/blob/main/misc/livescripts/E_PanTilt.sc)
* Run script see [How to run a live script](https://moonmodules.org/MoonLight/moonbase/module/liveScripts/#how-to-run-a-live-script)

## Modifier ðŸ’Ž Nodes
ðŸš§

### Pinwheel ðŸ’ŽðŸ’¡

Projects 1D/2D effects onto 2D/3D fixtures in a pinwheel pattern.

* **Swirl** option to bend the pinwheel.
* **Reverse** option.
* **Rotation Symmetry**: Controls the rotational symmetry of the pattern.
* **Petals** option to adjust the number of petals.
* **Ztwist** option for 3D fixtures to twist the pattern along the z-axis.
* The virtual layer width is the number of petals. The height is the distance from center to corner

### RippleYZ ðŸ’ŽðŸ’¡ðŸ’«

Takes lights of an effect and copies them to other lights. E.g. 1D effect will be rippled to 2D, 2D effect will be rippled to 3D

* shrink: shrinks the original size to towardsY and Z
* towardsY: copies X into Y
* towardsZ: copies XY into Z

ðŸš¨: some effects already do this theirselves e.g. FreqMatrix runs on 1D but copies to 2D and 3D if size allows.

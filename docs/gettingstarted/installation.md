   * The device will show in 'Captive portal' mode. Alternatively you can close the captive portal and show it in a browser using [http://4.3.2.1](http://4.3.2.1)

!!! warning "UI not showing when installing new version of MoonLight"

    If you ran previous versions of MoonLight, the UI might not show up if it has been changed since then. In this case it is needed to reload the UI from the ESP32-device (use [http://4.3.2.1](http://4.3.2.1))

    * Chrome: Command Shift R (Mac) or Ctrl Shift R or Control Reload (Windows)
    * Safari: Reload from Origin : Option Shift R
    * After this not all UI elements might be immediately visible. If you see 'MoonLight loading ...' in the browser, just wait a bit (‚òïÔ∏è)

    * Sometimes it migh be needed to clear the browser cache:
        * Chrome: Delete Browsing data / delete data (caching data)
        * Safari: Empty cache: Menu Develop (enable if not visible in the Safari Menu) / empty caches (Command Option E)

        * More info: [how to hard refresh your browser and clear cache](https://fabricdigital.co.nz/blog/how-to-hard-refresh-your-browser-and-clear-cache)

**Step 3**: Enter your local **WiFi network credentials** and hostname:

!!! tip "Hostname"

    The hostname will be used to access your device. E.g. if the hostname is ML-home you can access it using [http://ml-home.local](http://ml-home.local)

**Step 4**: Press **Add Network** and apply settings. After connecting to your normal WiFi network you will see this screen showing the new IP address of your MoonLight ESP32-device.

**Step 5**: When connected to your local WiFi network, enter the IP address of the new device. Alternatively enter the hostname.

!!! info "Using hostname"
    * Restart the device to make the hostname known to your network (go to system status, scroll down and press restart)
    * Enter the hostname in your browser e.g. [http://ml-home.local](http://ml-home.local)

!!! warning "reload UI"
    See step 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è if UI is not showing up, use [http://ml-home.local](http://ml-home.local) (replace ml-home with the hostname) or the IP address.

* Add a driver node by pressing the blue + button and select one of the ‚ò∏Ô∏è options.
    
!!! info "Strip or panel"
    The LEDs on your strip or panel should now show the effect

!!! tip "Choose driver"

    In some cases restart the device to make layout changes effective is needed.
  
**Step 4**: Press save (üíæ). Saves your setup to the file system, so if a device is restarted, your settings are still there.

# Hardware

To get started the minimal you need is an esp32-device connected via USB to your computer and a LED-strip or panel connected via 3 wires to the vcc, ground and a supported gpio pin of the esp32 (e.g. Pin 2). An ESP32-S3 is preferred as it has more memory to support large setups and Live Scripts. 

!!! info "ESP32-D0"

    Currently normal ESP32-devices (ESP32-D0, devices without PSRAM) are low on memory if MoonLight is installed. Therefor ESP32-D0-wrover or ESP32-S3 is recommended.

## Minimal hardware

* One of the ESP32-devices shown in [MoonLight Web Installer](https://raw.githack.com/MoonModules/MoonLight/refs/heads/main/firmware/installer/index.html). [ESP32-S3 N16R8](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBAtJ2H) recommended. Optional [Expansion board 44pin](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EJhmlIE)
* Any WS2812 LED strip or panel. [256 LED panel](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EIKoYrg) recommended.
* Connect the ESP32-device with USB to your computer, connect the LED strip or panel

Above is the minimum requirement to have lights burning.

## Recommended hardware

The [M5Stack AtomS3R](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/AtomS3R) will be used to offer 'MoonLight in a box'. 
It is perfactly usable to drive Art-Net. To drive LEDs a few more components are needed:

Work in progress to make this available as pre-assembled board ([Contact](https://discord.gg/TC8NSUSCdV) us if you want to help manufactering this).
